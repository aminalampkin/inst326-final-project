# INST326 Final Project
"""
Our project focused on cleaning and analyzing a dataset of Olympic history across 120 years. We examined the relationships between the top performing countries and their physiques (height, weight, age, and body mass index).

This code creates subsets of two countries (the country with the most medals and the country with the 5th most amount of medals) from 3 different years of Olympic games
The subsets can then be compared using methods such as regression and t-testing.
The raw data set is manipulated to exact these changes.
Our findings are displayed when run and include graphs, charts, and standard python outputs.

Files included in the repository:
